# Colina Health (Git) — Iteration 7.3 Day 13 (2026-05-16 02:41)

> `data_mode: partial` — GitHub 401 (raseniero token); HCI D1–D6 carry-forward chain Day 13 ← … ← Day 7 fresh (2026-05-10).

**UPS 82.3 🟢 Low** · ICS 95.9% · HCI 73/100 · SGPI 62.1%. Iteration 7.3 Day 13 of 14 (92.9% elapsed; sprint end May 17, 0 working days remaining).

## Scores

| Metric | Value | Band | Notes |
|--------|------:|------|-------|
| **UPS** | 82.3 | 🟢 Low | ICS×0.50 + HCI×0.30 + SGPI×0.20 = 47.95 + 21.90 + 12.42 |
| **ICS — Iteration Compliance** | 95.9% | 🟢 Low | AB#204200 OTP blocker lacks Feature parent + late-sprint injection (Alignment + Integrity 90.9%) |
| **HCI — Health Check Index** | 73/100 | 🟡 Moderate | −1 vs Day 12 (D8: OTP blocker Active 26+ hrs unresolved) |
| **SGPI — Sprint Goal Progress** | 62.1% | 🟡 Moderate | 18 of 29 committed SP Closed (7 items); no new closures since Day 9 |

## Top signals

- **AB#202586** (Restructure /lib, 5 SP) advanced Active → Peer Testing (May 15 13:53) — all three open Enablers (AB#202584/202586/202587, 11 SP) now in QA; sprint fate in Luzmibel's hands.
- **AB#204200** OTP login/reset blocker remains Active 26+ hrs — the only Active item at sprint close; missing Feature parent.
- SGPI flat at 62.1% (second consecutive day); pace gap −30.8 pts (62.1% delivered vs 92.9% elapsed).
- AB#203604 QA Spike (Luzmibel, 2 SP) closed May 15 07:05.
- Stale PRs worsening: AI-agent PR#9 82+ days (6th consecutive audit); ADO PR#11207 97+ days. ADO↔GitHub traceability 9.1% (1 of 11).

## Δ vs prior

Prior wiki page is 2026-05-11 (Iteration 7.3 Day 8, UPS 73.4 / ICS 98.0 / HCI 79 / SGPI 3.4%). This is the **Yellow→Green jump**: UPS 73.4 → 82.3 (+8.9), SGPI 3.4% → 62.1% (the 6 Ready-for-UAT items closed in the Day-9 bulk closure). ICS −2.1 (98.0→95.9, AB#204200 injection), HCI −6 (79→73, carry-forward D8/D10 normalization + OTP velocity). The source's own delta vs Day 12 shows UPS −0.3, flat — that masks the multi-day move visible in the wiki chain.

## Open questions

- Can the 3 Peer Testing Enablers (11 SP) + OTP blocker clear QA before May 17 (Saturday/Sunday)? Conservative 82.8% / Likely 86.2% SGPI.
- Will AB#204200 get a Feature parent and same-day fix, or spill to 7.4?
- Asnari closed 14 of 18 SP (77.8%); Paul carries all 4 open items — bus-factor risk at sprint end.

## Notes

- Source audit: `../../git_cc_dev/audit/AUDIT_20260516_0241.md` (partial — GitHub 401, HCI D1–D6 carry-forward)
- AB#203672 excluded — IterationPath is 8.1, not 7.3.
